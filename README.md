## Introduction
The transition to renewable energy sources and decentralized energy systems has led to the development of energy communities, where local groups produce, consume, and share energy collectively. 
Efficient management and optimization of these communities require robust tools to monitor and control energy flows. 
This repository presents a dashboard designed specifically for energy communities, enabling real-time data visualization, performance analysis, and decision support.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
